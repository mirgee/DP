PROBLEM STATEMENT
* Depression diagnosis is time consuming, requires professionals -> looking for cheap methods of diagnosis
* EEG is good - cheap
* Are there depression biomarkers in depression?

* Sometimes, drs. are not interested only in diagnosis, but also prognosis for the patient - how do they respond to treatment
* This is even more difficult to asses
* Very little work has been done on this

  APPROACHES
  * I have been looking into the literature, there is a long history of using methods of non-linear dynamical analysis of the system, mostly on small datasets (very carefully preprocessed)
  * More recently also DL has been applied
  * So I decided to try to try to apply these methods on larger dataset

THE DATA
* Show how the data looks like (graphs, histograms, tables, any viz)

NLDA
* Measures like ..., can go into detail in questions
* Not easy, have to select embedding parameters - need automatic procedure
* Show few examples, show e.g. ILD which I implemented
* Show results

DL
* NL analysis inspires -> convert data to image -> CNN, another poss. just raw data, CNN also may work
* Tried traditional architectures successful at image recongition, not very good
* Came across a paper which used architecture inspired by technique called FBCSP -> implemented
* Results

LIMITATIONS
* Signals in closeby parts are correlated (see Stam to formulate better), use information better
* ...?

FUTURE WORK
* Implement app with NN which may assist doctors easily (working on it)
* Do NNs encode the NL measures? Looking at the weights, they look at similar channels
* ...?

THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION
